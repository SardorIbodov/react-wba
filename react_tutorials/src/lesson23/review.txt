1. Batching => React 18 vs React 17 => Differences in rendering
In React 17 number of setStates equals number of re-renders
But in React 18 there is Batching that groups all setStates and re-renders only one timeout

If we want that React 18 also behaive like React 17 then, we use flushSync. It brings callback function

2. [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition() => useful with Search Engine Optimization

3. useDeferredValue() => we use it, in parent-child relationship, same with useTransition

4. <Suspense fallback="loading...">
	 	{Element}
	 </Suspense>
